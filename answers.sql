CREATE DATABASE salesDB; -- This query creates a database named salesDB

-- Before droping a database, we must ensure that it is created, so we'll first create a database named demo. 

CREATE DATABASE demo; -- This query creates a database named demo.

DROP DATABASE demo; --- Then this query drops the database named demo, which we just created.

--For the first question, I used the CREATE DATABASE statement to make a new database named "salesDB". This is the standard SQL syntax for creating databases.
--For the second question, I first created a database then I used the DROP DATABASE statement to permanently delete the database named "demo".
